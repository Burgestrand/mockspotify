# Mock::Spotify for Ruby as a separate gem is no more!
This was an overly ambitious project of me to maintain a gem for development
of Ruby libspotify bindings. This gem now lives inside [Hallon][], and will
be developed as a part of Hallon.

If you ever need this gem, for whatever reason, feel free to contact me.
